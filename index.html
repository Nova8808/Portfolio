									Steve Serpe</h1>
									<p>I am currently an independent game developer located in Denver looking to switch over to non-game development programming. Always eager to learn new languages and frameworks. If you want a self directed, quick learning programmer who is hungry to prove their programming skills I may be 
								    what your team needs. <i class="icon brands fa-linkedin"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-serpe/">@steven-serpe</a></i></p>

									<h2 class="major">Programming Level</h2>
									<p>My data structures and algorithms skill is currently around Leetcode medium and I would welcome any assessments to prove my skill. I try to do one or two problems per day and recently have felt confident enough to tackle hards.
										My strongest OOP language is C# and I am most familiar working in Visual Studio on the .NET framework. At Regis University I did computer science course
									    work in C++ (see github). I would feel comfortable in Java due to its similarity to C#. I know the basics of Javascript and I have a project planned in the near future to learn Python by making an API data aggregating app.

									<h2 class="major">Magefall - Made in Unity (.NET) and C#</h2>
									<p>Magefall is a PC game released for sale on Steam 8/1/2022. My passion for programming and turning creative ideas into reality was the fuel I used to teach myself how to make a game from scratch. Moving an
										idea from design to release is a great learning experience in planning, adaption and meeting deadlines. The game was made with thousands of lines of C# code using the Unity game engine. 
										Committing to a months long project and sticking with it to the end though all the challenges allowed me to grow greatly as a programmer and grow my confidence in being able to deliver finished software projects.

									<h2 class="major">Job Application Tracking Web App</h2>
									<p>A job search is a full time endevor and keeping oraganized and tracking progress can be useful. Using Visual Studio I created a ASP.NET MVC using Entity Framework. This allowed me to connect an SQL database to a basic CRUD 
										web page. A job and followup class was created and corresponding database tables. Adding a controller for each allowed API style Create/Read/Update/Delete. I added an API endpoint so using a tool like Postman I am able to
										access the data though an API interface. Using this I know who I applied to, when I applied, the job title and the job location. On the follow ups page I am able to track and detail any application follow ups.

									<h2 class="major">Chrome Extension</h2>
									<p>Thinking like a programmer means always thinking about ways you can use software to improve your life. A capable programmer can be confident in being able to create whatever solution is needed. It becomes a skill to be able
										to be thrown into something completely new and get fast at digging in and start learning on your own. 
									</p>
									<p>One day I realized I was utilizing Reddit to access information and collect useful experiences from users but the default
										search wasn't effective or efficient for me. So I set out to learn how to make a Chrome extension and a few hours later I had a button I could click to get exactly the information I wanted with no hassle. Solving problems
									    and automating solutions is a big part of why I love programming. </p>

									<h2 class="major">C++ House Listing Database</h2>
									<p>This was a class project at Regis University. Course work in computer science helped me learn to write well documented and clean code. I also felt that having my foundational language in programming
										be in C++ since it is a lower level language.

									<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Above all I would like to impress on potential employers that I truly am a passionate programmer. I love creating something and watching it work. Becuase of this I am sincerely excited to learn new things and I want to learn fast
										so I can start getting programs up and running. I work extremely hard when learning something new to come up to pace quickly as I am not content being confused or incapable when trying to write software. Becuase of this I 
										feel I am worth taking a chance on and can quickly grow into being a highly productive team member.
